Tourism has again been identified as a key driver of economic recovery and growth in a new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).3 months ago,https://www.unwto.org/news/tourism-s-importance-for-growth-highlighted-in-world-economic-outlook-report,"
Tourism has again been identified as a key driver of economic recovery and growth in a new report by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). With UNWTO data pointing to a return to 95% of pre-pandemic tourist numbers by the end of the year in the best case scenario, the IMF report outlines the positive impact the sector’s rapid recovery will have on certain economies worldwide.
 According to the World Economic Outlook (WEO) Report, the global economy will grow an estimated 3.0% in 2023 and 2.9% in 2024. While this is higher than previous forecasts, it is nevertheless below the 3.5% rate of growth recorded in 2022, pointing to the continued impacts of the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and from the cost-of-living crisis. The WEO report analyses economic growth in every global region, connecting performance with key sectors, including tourism. Notably, those economies with ""large travel and tourism sectors"" show strong economic resilience and robust levels of economic activity. More specifically, countries where tourism represents a high percentage of GDP   have recorded faster recovery from the impacts of the pandemic in comparison to economies where tourism is not a significant sector."

Its multicultural ethos and rich diversity is a hotspot of conflict.Pakistan stands at the 84th position in a group of 121 countries in the 2023 Global Soft Power Index by brand evaluation consultancy ‘Brand Finance’, trailing far behind the regional adversary India at 28th. In the 2023 Global Firepower Ranking, Pakistan ranks seventh out of 145 countries. This may be a consolation for a country with limited resources and a mighty army.The country needs hard power, undoubtedly, but the glaring disparity vis-a-vis soft power resources is a cause for concern domestically and internationally. The global soft power index is based on almost 40 metrics on “the quality of a country’s political institutions, the extent of their cultural appeal, the strength of their diplomatic network, the global reputation of their higher education system, the attractiveness of their economic model, and a country’s digital engagement with the world.”Dropping from the 63rd position in 2021 to 84th in 2023 is indeed a downward slide. American political scientist Joseph Nye, who is a proponent of soft power, has summed up these various metrics into three basic resources of soft power: political ideals, culture and foreign policy. He defines soft power as the “ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion.”Since post-cold war Western countries have used soft power resources strategically to enhance their global position and achieve their desired foreign policy objectives. The US is considered the bastion of soft power with its liberal democratic order and cultural exports – from Hollywood movies to Madonna and from Google to Harvard and Coca Cola to McDonald’s.American artists and musicians have acted as cultural ambassadors during peace and pandemics. China has also utilized its soft power image, blending its cultural and commercial appeal. With its Confucius institutes in 162 countries, the country sponsors educational and training programmes for foreign students. Despite an assertive foreign policy against the US, Taiwan, India, and Hong Kong, the soft power image of China could not erode owing to its massive commercial appeal through multi-trillion dollar infrastructure and investment projects in Asia, Pacific, America and Africa.India is making waves through Bollywood movies, music, Silicon Valley and its thriving tourism. South Korea is sweeping the world through its popular boy band BTS – which is smashing records – Oscar wins, the growing drama industry and skincare goods. By enhancing cultural attraction and promoting democratic political ideals and a strong economic model of development, a country promotes a credible image internationally using the soft power resources and positively impacts how people think or interact with them.Soft power gets into action when a country strategically taps its domestic core assets into specific foreign policy goals and establishes moral authority to get what it wants from the others.Unfortunately for Pakistan, its cultural appeal could not be enhanced around the world due to a lack of support and direction from the government. The media – including entertainment – is a dying industry and tourism and sports is stifled due to the worsening law and order situation. The political journey has been messy. The country’s fragile democracy keeps getting derailed. Civil supremacy remains the main casualty in such a political crisis. The country’s record of human rights abuses is abysmal, attracting the ire of local and international media on issues like freedom of speech, media censorship, violence against women, custodial torture, contempt of law, and targeting political opposition and journalists.Pakistan’s dire economic situation has damaged its soft power image globally. We have signed hundreds of bilateral and multilateral trade agreements with countries, but our exports are constantly shrinking, rupee devaluing, foreign currency reserves depleting, entrepreneurial genius nose-diving, and private investment dwindling. Pakistan has had 21 IMF bailouts, and yet there is no relief in sight. That Pakistan – an agrarian country – is in danger of high food insecurity like Ethiopia, Kenya and Syria as reported by the FAO-WFP report is alarming.Our foreign policy objectives are either narrow or ambiguous. We have disputes with almost all our neighbours. And this has tarnished our global image and potential trade advantage. Our public diplomacy is nonexistent and cultural diplomacy never took roots. With poor law and order, hosting of international events has been a great challenge.While the world is competing for supremacy in gaining soft power to get its desired foreign policy objectives, it is unfortunate to see how poorly we have used our national capacity to advance our priorities. Our multi-ethnic culture is hostile to others; our political credibility is eroded at home and abroad; the strength of our diplomatic network is waning; the economy is near default; and our foreign policies in the world lack legitimacy and moral authority.Pakistan has tremendous assets in the soft power area which must be developed in conjunction with hard power to augment legitimacy to the state’s power position in the global system. A strategic and sustained effort is needed by the government along with the private sector to promote cultural and public diplomacy.Social media can be used to engage, inform, and encourage participation on domestic and foreign policy fronts. Pakistan is at a critical juncture and it is time the world continued to regard us as a tolerant and pluralistic democracy with a benign international influence and an emerging economy. It’s a long and arduous journey. The work must begin, seriously and consistently.The writer holds an LLM degree ininternational economic law from the University of Warwick.

Our multi-ethnic culture is hostile to others; our political credibility is eroded at home and abroad; the strength of our diplomatic network is waning; the economy is near default; and our foreign policies in the world lack legitimacy and moral authority.Pakistan has tremendous assets in the soft power area which must be developed in conjunction with hard power to augment legitimacy to the state’s power position in the global system. A strategic and sustained effort is needed by the government along with the private sector to promote cultural and public diplomacy.Social media can be used to engage, inform, and encourage participation on domestic and foreign policy fronts. Pakistan is at a critical juncture and it is time the world continued to regard us as a tolerant and pluralistic democracy with a benign international influence and an emerging economy. It’s a long and arduous journey. The work must begin, seriously and consistently.The writer holds an LLM degree ininternational economic law from the University of Warwick.

I believe in Pakistan and take my beloved country everywhere I go since I am an unannounced ambassador of my beautiful country, which has so much to offer to the world and yet to be seen by its own population but, unfortunately, the mesmerising cultural and tourist attractions of this greatest gift of God to us has not been shown to the world, in the way it really deserves”.These are the heartfelt sentiments of Tehreem Saigol, the first woman hotelier in Pakistan, introducing a new kind of hospitality concept. Tehreem is an ardent advocate of the promotion of local, as well as international tourism in this magnificent country of her birth.Talking to The News, Tehreem disclosed that she was the first Pakistani to be enrolled and educated at the Royal College in England and lived a long time there, but she never forgot Pakistan and promoted it wherever she went. For choosing the tourism and hotel industry, she maintained that “I got obsessed with the idea of bringing the true face of Pakistan to the world; therefore, I plunged myself in the hotel industry with a passion, because, she added, you can never do justice to your passion and your objectives without passion”. She maintained that she was so possessive about Pakistan that she would talk for hours and hours to the foreigners in every European and other country she would visit. She revealed that she has travelled throughout the length and breath of Pakistan’s Northern Areas and was mesmerised by its breath-taking unspoiled beauty. Every part of this magnificent country has many cultural and tourist landmarks. It is brimming with centuries old cultural assets on one hand and with matchless natural beauty on the other. Before plunging herself into one of the most competitive industry in this country, she combed the best tourist place in Pakistan, particularly up north. The day she landed on this soil, she embarked on a journey of serenity and joy right from the planes of Punjab to the snow-capped peaks. She argued that initially, there is no need for huge investments and mega infrastructures to make the best out of these natural treasures Pakistan holds but dedicated and sincere efforts with an effective planning is required to make out best of our tourism industry. She pointed out that the Western media has been blowing things out of proportions when it comes down to Pakistan-related incidents. Tragedies and terrorism is everywhere in the world in one form or the other and so are the dangers.

I believe in Pakistan and take my beloved country everywhere I go since I am an unannounced ambassador of my beautiful country, which has so much to offer to the world and yet to be seen by its own population but, unfortunately, the mesmerising cultural and tourist attractions of this greatest gift of God to us has not been shown to the world, in the way it really deserves”.These are the heartfelt sentiments of Tehreem Saigol, the first woman hotelier in Pakistan, introducing a new kind of hospitality concept.

She maintained that she was so possessive about Pakistan that she would talk for hours and hours to the foreigners in every European and other country she would visit. She revealed that she has travelled throughout the length and breath of Pakistan’s Northern Areas and was mesmerised by its breath-taking unspoiled beauty. Every part of this magnificent country has many cultural and tourist landmarks. It is brimming with centuries old cultural assets on one hand and with matchless natural beauty on the other. Before plunging herself into one of the most competitive industry in this country, she combed the best tourist place in Pakistan, particularly up north. The day she landed on this soil, she embarked on a journey of serenity and joy right from the planes of Punjab to the snow-capped peaks. She argued that initially, there is no need for huge investments and mega infrastructures to make the best out of these natural treasures Pakistan holds but dedicated and sincere efforts with an effective planning is required to make out best of our tourism industry.

We have plenty of religious, cultural and heritage sites too. These are not just related to the Mughal and British eras. Our history goes back thousands of years, and we have the sites to show for it. Harappa, Mohenjodaro and Taxila are excellent examples but there are many others. Baba Nanak was born and has his resting place in what is now Pakistan. But we do very poorly in tourism. I recently came to Turkey for a trip. The contrast could not be greater. It is estimated that Turkey received around $40 billion in the first nine months of 2023 through tourism. Seeing the place one can believe that. It was simple to get the online visa that was granted an hour after the application. Immigration formalities took two minutes in Istanbul. The officer asked no questions; she just checked our visas and let us proceed. The green channel took care of Customs and we were outside in five minutes. Though few people know English here, they are extremely welcoming. If you ask someone for help, they usually go out of their way to help. Shopkeepers are the same. People can dress any way they like. On the same street, you see men in T-shirts and shorts and in traditional dress, and women in the shortest possible skirt and others in black burqas and face-covering hijabs. Nobody asks questions, nobody stares, nobody makes individual space and individual choices an issue.

Inflation wreaked havoc on the world economy, rising global temperatures brought about even more destruction and if that weren’t enough, new frontiers opened up for humans to kill each other. That is not to say that good things didn’t happen — amid all the darkness, there were glimmers of hope, shining through random acts of kindness by heroes who don’t wear capes. At the local level, the year started with a staring contest between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the finance czar, Ishaq Dar — that set the tone for one of the highest inflationary spirals in the country’s history. Over the next few months, we saw a judiciary in turmoil, a polity so polarised, it invented new ways to snuff out the opposition and a state that made every excuse in the playbook to deny people the power of the ballot and often, their basic civil rights. Here at Prism, we tried our best to make sense of it all — to provide you with in-depth analysis of events that directly or indirectly impacted you.

Unfortunately, the scenes witnessed on Wednesday and Thursday in Karachi’s Seaview area were shocking. They did not reflect well on the psyche of Karachiites. People made their way in huge numbers to the beach to ‘enjoy’ the sight of Mother Nature unleashing her wrath. All this happened as the administration and disaster management authorities issued warnings of the dire impact that Cyclone Biparjoy would have. Karachi may not have been directly in the line of the cyclone’s wrath, but the public’s attitude left much to be desired anyway. Anticipating the public’s tendency not to obey orders, Section 144 had been imposed and the police stationed on the spot. Yet nothing could stop the adventure-seekers out to have some fun. The people did exactly what the authorities expected they would. How should one describe this cavalier behaviour? Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman aptly termed it ‘disaster tourism’, while appealing to the people not to expose themselves to the danger. I will simply describe it as the height of stupidity and selfishness — after all the warnings had been issued. The episode has left me wondering why our people behave in this bizarre manner. We still have to recover from last year’s catastrophic floods that left Sindh devastated. What is worse, the province is even now a ravaged place. With the exception of some areas where people have managed to reconstruct their homes without any official assistance and where life has begun to return to some semblance of normality, Sindh has a long way to go to return to the pre-2022 situation. Some villages destroyed then remain deserted today as their inhabitants have not returned. Many schools collapsed and were never replaced by new ones. I don’t know if the government has even carried out a survey and kept count of the schools that are no more. Where are the children and where are the teachers?"

In the case of Sri Lanka, the downturn began in 2019 with the fall of the tourism industry, which is the third largest source of foreign reserves after remittances and the garment industry. In 2018, the industry generated a whopping $4.44bn in reserves, constituting 5.2pc of the gross national product (GNP). However, in 2019, the influx of tourists decreased considerably due to security concerns after the Easter Sunday Bombings. Soon after, Covid-19 forced the country to shut its doors to visitors. The industry contracted to $0.62bn in 2021, a mere 0.7pc of the GNP. Even after the pandemic, the industry struggled to revive due to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict."

You are scrolling through LinkedIn and looking at all the gurus talking about the unstoppable rise of Pakistan’s startup scene. After all, the country had raised $365 million in investment during 2021, almost 6x the value of the previous year. The optimism is contagious, even if the posts are cringe and cliched. Fast forward to now, and all of those self-styled gurus have changed gears, having spent the last 12 months or so to become an expert on monetary economics and its history. It’s a milder version of crypto bros becoming AI guys after their decentralised heroes turned out to be frauds. In Pakistan, too, those who sold the optimism drug while labelling the sceptics as anti-progress are now on the sidelines and talking about how unsustainable and out of touch the good old days really were."

Linked by culture, religion, geography and history to Pakistan, our western neighbour offers a window into hundreds of years of Islamic history, as well as serene spiritual moments at the holy sites in Qom and Mashhad. In the Western world, Iran — rather unfairly — gets a bad rap due to major geopolitical differences in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, though Westerners do continue to visit the country. For Pakistanis, however, there are no barriers standing in the way to visiting Iran, either for ziarat [religious pilgrimage] or general tourism purposes. Though there are no Pakistan-specific numbers, according to the Tehran Times over four million foreign tourists visited Iran in 2022. It would not be wrong to assume a significant proportion of these were Pakistanis."

Although we see some foreign tourists and mountaineers in the country, we are yet to exploit the real potential that Pakistan has. Boosting the tourism sector could be a wise step, especially when we have been going through one economic crisis or the other for the last four years. To attract larger number of foreign tourists and put the sector on the right track, we need to take a few initiatives. The most important one is the image of Pakistan in the eyes of the world. There are many case studies that tell us how to do it. We can highlight the country and its achievements in art and culture, creating a soft image of the country. A case in point is Ms Marvel, a six-episode series that has attracted the attention of the young across the world, including the West. All we need is to cash in on such events just like India does."

In the past five years, domestic tourism in Pakistan has increased exponentially. According to the Pakistan Tourism Development Corporation (PTDC), it is estimated that 80 million tourists travelled within Pakistan, mostly between May and August. The numbers have been growing since 2013. Several factors have contributed to this growth, including better infrastructure, increased awareness about travel-worthy places and a rise in the number of tour operators. The northern parts of Pakistan have historically been the most popular places for domestic tourism – and for good reason, as northern Pakistan offers some of the most scenic landscapes found on the face of our planet, as well as a pleasant summer climate. However, there has now been a surge in tourism in the southern parts of the country to spots that were previously little-known as tourist attractions; these include Gorakh Hill, Gwadar and National Hingol Park. Their popularity started to rise when a few tour operators began offering tours to these locations. They shared their photos on social media and prompted other groups to start offering tours there as well. These spots have now become mainstream tourist attractions. People who found it cost- or time-prohibitive to fly from southern Pakistan to Islamabad in order to go up north, have turned to these spots in the south for weekend trips."

Unfortunately, the scenes witnessed on Wednesday and Thursday in Karachi’s Seaview area were shocking. They did not reflect well on the psyche of Karachiites. People made their way in huge numbers to the beach to ‘enjoy’ the sight of Mother Nature unleashing her wrath. All this happened as the administration and disaster management authorities issued warnings of the dire impact that Cyclone Biparjoy would have. Karachi may not have been directly in the line of the cyclone’s wrath, but the public’s attitude left much to be desired anyway. Anticipating the public’s tendency not to obey orders, Section 144 had been imposed and the police stationed on the spot. Yet nothing could stop the adventure-seekers out to have some fun. The people did exactly what the authorities expected they would. How should one describe this cavalier behaviour? Federal Minister for Climate Change Sherry Rehman aptly termed it ‘disaster tourism’, while appealing to the people not to expose themselves to the danger. I will simply describe it as the height of stupidity and selfishness — after all the warnings had been issued. The episode has left me wondering why our people behave in this bizarre manner. We still have to recover from last year’s catastrophic floods that left Sindh devastated. What is worse, the province is even now a ravaged place. With the exception of some areas where people have managed to reconstruct their homes without any official assistance and where life has begun to return to some semblance of normality, Sindh has a long way to go to return to the pre-2022 situation. Some villages destroyed then remain deserted today as their inhabitants have not returned. Many schools collapsed and were never replaced by new ones. I don’t know if the government has even carried out a survey and kept count of the schools that are no more. Where are the children and where are the teachers?"

At the local level, the year started with a staring contest between the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the finance czar, Ishaq Dar — that set the tone for one of the highest inflationary spirals in the country’s history. Over the next few months, we saw a judiciary in turmoil, a polity so polarised, it invented new ways to snuff out the opposition and a state that made every excuse in the playbook to deny people the power of the ballot and often, their basic civil rights.

You are scrolling through LinkedIn and looking at all the gurus talking about the unstoppable rise of Pakistan’s startup scene. After all, the country had raised $365 million in investment during 2021, almost 6x the value of the previous year. The optimism is contagious, even if the posts are cringe and cliched. Fast forward to now, and all of those self-styled gurus have changed gears, having spent the last 12 months or so to become an expert on monetary economics and its history. It’s a milder version of crypto bros becoming AI guys after their decentralised heroes turned out to be frauds. In Pakistan, too, those who sold the optimism drug while labelling the sceptics as anti-progress are now on the sidelines and talking about how unsustainable and out of touch the good old days really were."

Linked by culture, religion, geography and history to Pakistan, our western neighbour offers a window into hundreds of years of Islamic history, as well as serene spiritual moments at the holy sites in Qom and Mashhad. In the Western world, Iran — rather unfairly — gets a bad rap due to major geopolitical differences in the aftermath of the 1979 Islamic Revolution, though Westerners do continue to visit the country. For Pakistanis, however, there are no barriers standing in the way to visiting Iran, either for ziarat [religious pilgrimage] or general tourism purposes. Though there are no Pakistan-specific numbers, according to the Tehran Times over four million foreign tourists visited Iran in 2022. It would not be wrong to assume a significant proportion of these were Pakistanis."

I was one of those people, stranded at Zero Point in Chilas, KP, for days. I spent hours on the road, navigating traffic jams in Naran the Wednesday after Eid. I see people flocking in tens of thousands to Pakistan’s northern areas. I see hope. Human beings have an innate love for beauty, and for nature. Across Pakistan, families with very modest means still manage to build a kabootar-ghar — a pigeon coop — on the roof of their homes. On holidays and in good weather, Karachiites flock to the beach and Lahoris to Bagh-i-Jinnah and the ancient gardens of the city. We could be satisfied by the hill stations of Murree and the beautiful mountain cities of Abbottabad, Mansehra and Balakot but something pulls us over to the wilderness of Babusar Pass, where you can witness unspoiled, untouched valleys as far as the eye can see. In July this year, I spent two of my 18 hours on the road sitting in my car at a single-lane bridge in Battakundi, cursing the traffic. As the knot of cars untangled, we passed a coaster full of holidaymakers. A young girl leaned out of the window, her chin propped on her arms, the dupatta on her head pushed back by the breeze, an utterly blissful expression on her face, her eyes transfixed on the mountains around her. I was once that girl, riding a coaster up to the tallest peaks in the world for the first time. I would not take that feeling away for the world.

The system released recently ranks countries from 1 to 4 based on their safety for American travellers. The new system, she added, would clear up the confusion between the alerts and warnings, and make clear to American travellers planning their summer travels where they should and should not go.  She is not entirely wrong. Ironic as it may seem, given their predilection for lethal weaponry, Americans are obsessed with safety abroad. In the Trump era, where rhetoric from the White House consistently paints most of the rest of the world as an ominous place, full of hatred for America and Americans’ bounty and luck, this habit has become an obsession. The irony is not limited to guns; even as Americans support erecting walls to keep out Latin Americans and Mexicans from its southern border, ban Muslims, denigrate family reunification, they continue to believe in their own entitled right to rank other countries in this way and traipse into them for tourism and vacations."
